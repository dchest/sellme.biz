<p><blockquote></p>
<p>
<p>...You don't adopt the mannerisms of big, successful companies when you're small, because those mannerisms aren't what made the companies successful.</p>
<p></p></p>
<p>
<p>They're actually symptoms of what is killing the company, because it's become too big. It's like if you meet an really old, really rich guy covered in liver spots and breathing with an oxygen tank, and you say, "I want to be rich, too, so I'm going to start walking with a cane and I'm going to act crotchety and I'm going to get liver disease."</p>
