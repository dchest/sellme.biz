title: "You don't play it safe"

<p><blockquote>You guys have had nothing but success. What do you do with it? You don’t play it safe—you do something that scares you, that’s at the edge of your capabilities, where you might fail. That’s what gets you up in the morning.</p>
<p></blockquote></p>
<p>— Brad Bird, Pixar</p>
